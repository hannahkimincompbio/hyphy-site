Resources
===================

* [Tutorials](./tutorials/current-release-tutorial) for using HyPhy to infer selection with various methods. Detailed descriptions of these methods are available [here](./getting-started/#choosing-a-method-for-selection-inference).

* Book chapters and Powerpoints detailing HyPhy usage:
      * [Quantifying Natural Selection in Coding Sequences (2016)](resources-files/slides-selection-2016.pdf) 
      * [HyPhy Book: Estimating selection pressures on alignments of
coding sequences (2007)](resources-files/hyphybook2007.pdf)
      * [Introduction: Compartmentalization Detection](resources-files/compartmentalization_detection_ppt.pdf) 

* Getting help
      * See the current [Github Issues](https://www.github.com/veg/hyphy/issues) page for posting questions or searching queries from other users.
      * The retired (as of 2014) user forum is also available for viewing [here](http://www.hyphy.org/cgi-bin/hyphy_forums/YaBB.pl).
