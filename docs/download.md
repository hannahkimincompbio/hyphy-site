### Download and Install GUI

To download the Desktop/GUI version of HyPhy, follow instructions on this [download page](http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/Download). Note that the GUI is no longer maintained, and at this time we recommend using HyPhy either via [Datamonkey](http://datamonkey.org) or from the command line on your local computer/server. 

Alternatively, you may download an installer for an older release of HyPhy (version 2.2.4) for your specific operating system using the appropriate link:

* [Mac OSX](https://github.com/veg/hyphy/releases/download/2.2.4/hyphy.dmg)
* [Windows XP or later](https://github.com/veg/hyphy/releases/download/2.2.4/HyPhy2.2.4.exe)


### Download and Install from source

> HyPhy depends on [CMake >3.0](https://cmake.org/) for its build system. Before installing HyPhy, please make sure that an appropriate version of CMake has been installed. HyPhy additionally depends on other development libraries like
libcurl and libpthread. Libcurl requires development libraries such as crypto++ and openssl (or gnutls depending on your configuration). On Ubuntu these are libcurl-dev, libcrypto++-dev and libssl-dev.


**You can download HyPhy source in two ways:**

* Download a specific HyPhy release (we recommend the latest release) from [this github repository](https://github.com/veg/hyphy/releases).
* Download the master branch of HyPhy by cloning the repository by entering this command into a terminal session:

        git clone git@github.com:veg/hyphy.git
