This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nAlthough FUBAR produces similar information to FEL, it has several key differences:\n\n\n\n\nFUBAR employs a Bayesian algorithm to infer rates, and therefore it reports evidence for positive selection using \nposterior probabilities\n (which range from 0-1), not p-values. Generally, posterior probabilities \n 0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection. \n\n\nFUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.\n\n\nFUBAR may have more power than FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak (i.e. low values of \n\\omega>1\n).\n\n\n\n\nIf you use FUBAR in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for inferring selection.\" Mol.

Importantly, to infer \n\\omega\n rates, MEME infers a single \n\\alpha\n (dS) value and two separate \n\\beta\n (dN) values, \n\\beta^-\n and \n\\beta^+\n, which share the same \n\\alpha\n, per site. For both the null and alternative model, MEME enforces the constraint \n\\beta^- \\leq \\alpha\n. The \n\\beta^+\n parameter is therefore the key difference between null and alternative models: In the null model, \n\\beta^+\n is constrained as in the null model: \n\\beta^+ \\leq \\alpha\n, but \n\\beta^+\n is not constrained in the alternative model. Ultimately, positive selection for each site is inferred when \n\\beta^+ > \\alpha\n and shown to be significant using the likelihood ratio test. \n\n\nIf you use MEME in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Detecting individual sites subject to episodic diversifying selection.\" PLoS Genetics 8, e1002764 (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\naBSREL\n#\n\n\naBSREL is an improved version of the commonly-used \"branch-site\" models, which are used to test if positive selection has occurred on a proportion of branches. As such, aBSREL models both site-level and branch-level \n\\omega\n  heterogeneity. aBSREL, however, does not test for selection at specific sites. Instead, aBSREL will test, for each branch (or branch of interest) in the phylogeny, whether a proportion of sites have evolved under positive selection. \n\n\naBSREL differs from other branch-site model implementations by inferring the optimal number of \n\\omega\n  classes for each branch. For example, the earlier HyPhy branch-site approach (BS-REL) assumed three \n\\omega\n  rate classes for each branch and assigned each site, with some probability, to one of these classes. aBSREL, by contrast, acknowledges that different branches may feature more or less complex evolutionary patterns and hence may be better modeled by more or fewer \n\\omega\n classes. Specifically, aBSREL uses AIC\nc\n (small sample AIC) to infer the optimal number of \n\\omega\n rate classes for each branch. \n\n\nAfter aBSREL fits the full adaptive model, the Likelihood Ratio Test is performed at each branch and compares the full model to a null model where branches are not allowed to have rate classes of \n\\omega>1\n. \n\n\naBSREL can be run in two modes:\n\n\n\n\nTest a specific hypothesis by \na priori\n selecting a set of \"foreground\" branches to test for positive selection. \n\n\nPerform an exploratory analysis where all branches are tested for positive selection. In this scenario, p-values at each branch must be corrected for multiple testing (using the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Due to multiple testing, the exploratory approach \nhas much lower power\n compared to the other approach. \n\n\n\n\nIf you use aBSREL in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nSmith, MD et al. \"Less is more: an adaptive branch-site random effects model for efficient detection of episodic diversifying selection.\" Mol.

When running BUSTED, users can either specify a set of foreground branches on which to test for positive selection (remaining branches are designated \"background\"), or users can test the entire phylogeny for positive selection. In the latter case, the entire tree is effectively treated as foreground, and the test for positive selection considers the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nFor each phylogenetic partition (foreground and background branch sites), BUSTED fits a codon model with three rate classes, constrained as \n\\omega_1 \\leq \\omega_2 \\leq 1 \\leq \\omega_3\n. As in other methods, BUSTED simultaneously estimates the proportion of sites per partition belonging to each \n\\omega\n  class. This model, used as the alternative model in selection testing, is referred to as the \nUnconstrained\n model. BUSTED then tests for positive selection by comparing this model fit to a null model where \n\\omega_3 \\geq 1\n (i.e. disallowing positive selection) on the foreground branches. This null model is also referred to as the \nConstrained\n model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then there is evidence that at least one site has, at least some of the time, experienced positive selection on the foreground branches. Importantly, a significant result \ndoes not\n mean that the gene evolved under positive selection along the entire foreground.\n\n\nBUSTED additionally calculates \"Evidence Ratios\" (ERs) for each site. The ER gives the likelihood ratio (reported on a log-scale) that the alternative model was a better fit to the data compared to the null model. The ER for each site thus provides \ndescriptive information\n about whether a given site could have evolved under positive selection. The ERs \nshould not\n be interpreted as statistical evidence for positive selection at individual sites (instead, methods like \nMEME\n, \nFEL\n, or \nFUBAR\n should be used for detecting selection at individual sites). \n\n\nFor each site, two ERs are reported: the \nConstrained Model\n ER and the \nOptimized Null\n Model ER. The Constrained Model ER calculates the evidence ratio using model parameters inferred from the Constrained model. By contrast, the Optimized Null model ER re-optimizes parameters inferred using the Constrained model for the given site of interest. These optimized parameter values are then used to calculate the site's ER. Again, while these ERs may be helpful descriptors of selection in the data set, they do not provide statistically valid evidence for positive selection at a site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\nIf you use BUSTED in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Gene-wide identification of episodic selection.\" Mol.

RELAX is therefore \nnot\n a suitable method for explicitly testing for positive selection. Instead, RELAX is most useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection on a given gene.\n\n\nRELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each). RELAX begins by fitting a codon model with three \n\\omega\n  classes to the entire phylogeny (null model).

Specifically, RELAX fixes the inferred \n\\omega\n values (all \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}\n) and infers, for the test branches, a value for \nk\n which modifies the rates to \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}^k\n (alternative model). RELAX then conducts a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the alternative and null models. \n\n\nA significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified\n along the test branches, and a significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed\n along the test branches.\n\n\nIn addition to this pair of null/alternative models, RELAX fits three other models meant as complementary descriptors for the data, but are not suitable for hypothesis testing. These additional models include the following:\n\n\n\n\nPartitioned MG94xREV\n - This model fits a single \n\\omega\n value, i.e. shared for all sites, to each branch partition (reference and test). Here, a total of two \n\\omega\n rates are inferred.\n\n\nPartitioned Descriptive\n - This model, like a more standard branch-site model, fits three \n\\omega\n  classes separately to each branch partition (reference and test, producing a total of six estimated \n\\omega\n rates estimated). The selection intensity parameter \nk\n is not included.\n\n\nGeneral Descriptive\n - This model fits three \n\\omega\n  classes to the full data set, ignoring the specified test and reference partition division (three total \n\\omega\n rates estimated). It subsequently fits a \nk\n parameter at each branch, ultimately tailoring the three \n\\omega\n  class values to this branch. This model may serve as a useful description of how selection intensity fluctuates over the whole tree.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use RELAX in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nWertheim, JO et al. \"RELAX: detecting relaxed selection in a phylogenetic framework.\" Mol.

This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.  Although FUBAR produces similar information to FEL, it has several key differences:   FUBAR employs a Bayesian algorithm to infer rates, and therefore it reports evidence for positive selection using  posterior probabilities  (which range from 0-1), not p-values. Generally, posterior probabilities   0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection.   FUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.  FUBAR may have more power than FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak (i.e. low values of  \\omega>1 ).

Importantly, to infer  \\omega  rates, MEME infers a single  \\alpha  (dS) value and two separate  \\beta  (dN) values,  \\beta^-  and  \\beta^+ , which share the same  \\alpha , per site. For both the null and alternative model, MEME enforces the constraint  \\beta^- \\leq \\alpha .

As such, aBSREL models both site-level and branch-level  \\omega   heterogeneity. aBSREL, however, does not test for selection at specific sites. Instead, aBSREL will test, for each branch (or branch of interest) in the phylogeny, whether a proportion of sites have evolved under positive selection.   aBSREL differs from other branch-site model implementations by inferring the optimal number of  \\omega   classes for each branch. For example, the earlier HyPhy branch-site approach (BS-REL) assumed three  \\omega   rate classes for each branch and assigned each site, with some probability, to one of these classes. aBSREL, by contrast, acknowledges that different branches may feature more or less complex evolutionary patterns and hence may be better modeled by more or fewer  \\omega  classes. Specifically, aBSREL uses AIC c  (small sample AIC) to infer the optimal number of  \\omega  rate classes for each branch.   After aBSREL fits the full adaptive model, the Likelihood Ratio Test is performed at each branch and compares the full model to a null model where branches are not allowed to have rate classes of  \\omega>1 .   aBSREL can be run in two modes:   Test a specific hypothesis by  a priori  selecting a set of \"foreground\" branches to test for positive selection.   Perform an exploratory analysis where all branches are tested for positive selection. In this scenario, p-values at each branch must be corrected for multiple testing (using the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Due to multiple testing, the exploratory approach  has much lower power  compared to the other approach.

            "text": "BUSTED provides a gene-wide ( not site-specific ) test for positive selection by asking whether a gene has experienced positive selection at at least one site on at least one branch. When running BUSTED, users can either specify a set of foreground branches on which to test for positive selection (remaining branches are designated \"background\"), or users can test the entire phylogeny for positive selection. In the latter case, the entire tree is effectively treated as foreground, and the test for positive selection considers the entire phylogeny.  For each phylogenetic partition (foreground and background branch sites), BUSTED fits a codon model with three rate classes, constrained as  \\omega_1 \\leq \\omega_2 \\leq 1 \\leq \\omega_3 . As in other methods, BUSTED simultaneously estimates the proportion of sites per partition belonging to each  \\omega   class. This model, used as the alternative model in selection testing, is referred to as the  Unconstrained  model. BUSTED then tests for positive selection by comparing this model fit to a null model where  \\omega_3 \\geq 1  (i.e. disallowing positive selection) on the foreground branches. This null model is also referred to as the  Constrained  model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then there is evidence that at least one site has, at least some of the time, experienced positive selection on the foreground branches. Importantly, a significant result  does not  mean that the gene evolved under positive selection along the entire foreground.  BUSTED additionally calculates \"Evidence Ratios\" (ERs) for each site. The ER gives the likelihood ratio (reported on a log-scale) that the alternative model was a better fit to the data compared to the null model. The ER for each site thus provides  descriptive information  about whether a given site could have evolved under positive selection. The ERs  should not  be interpreted as statistical evidence for positive selection at individual sites (instead, methods like  MEME ,  FEL , or  FUBAR  should be used for detecting selection at individual sites).   For each site, two ERs are reported: the  Constrained Model  ER and the  Optimized Null  Model ER. The Constrained Model ER calculates the evidence ratio using model parameters inferred from the Constrained model. By contrast, the Optimized Null model ER re-optimizes parameters inferred using the Constrained model for the given site of interest. These optimized parameter values are then used to calculate the site's ER. Again, while these ERs may be helpful descriptors of selection in the data set, they do not provide statistically valid evidence for positive selection at a site.

RELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each).
